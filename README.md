Mayfly/Shadfly/Fishfly relief for lakeside dwellers
Lakeside living can be rather less than enjoyable during the annual Mayfly/Shadfly/Fishfly hatch.  Based on some reading that Mayflies don't migrate more than a few hundred meters from where they emerge from the water I thought local relief might be possible.  The basic plan is a LED flood light to attract them, duct around the LED, screen basket inside a 5 gallon bucket and vacuum source which for me was a old furnace blower fan which works but not optimal for suction.
 
This project is just some freecad files for cnc-ing the 3/4" plywood parts for the screen baskets and some 3d printed ducts. 

ToDo:
- Flapper valve to close inlet when suction is off so they can't escape
- Better fan design for suction

Dreams:
Auto unloader into the lake 

Yes this is a mass slaughter device - I'm a pretty left of center guy but it was me or them, I swear.
